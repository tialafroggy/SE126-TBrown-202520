# Program Name: Dictionary Search and Add.
# Week 9 Lab # 7
# Program Prompt: Access the words.csv file and store the data to a dictionary, where each word in the file is a key of the dictionary and the value stored to each key is the wordâ€™s corresponding definition. Then, create a repeatable program that allows a user to interact with the dictionary based on the following menu.

import csv

# Function to load words from CSV into a dictionary.
def loadWords(file_name):
    wordDict = {}

            for row in reader:
                word = row[0].strip()  # Word (no conversion to lowercase).
                definition = row[1].strip()  # Definition.
                wordDict[word] = definition
